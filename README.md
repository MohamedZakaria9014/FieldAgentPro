This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# FieldAgent Pro (Offline-First Core)

Core module implementation for the “FieldAgent Pro” offline-first challenge:

- Local DB: SQLite via `expo-sqlite` + `drizzle-orm`
- State: Redux Toolkit
- Tabs: Assignments / Schedule / Settings
- Animations/gestures: Reanimated + Gesture Handler
- Details: Bottom sheet (@gorhom/bottom-sheet)
- Background (Android): WorkManager worker + notification

## Offline-First Strategy

The UI never renders directly from the API response.

1. Fetch remote JSON (or fall back to the injected dataset).
2. Upsert into SQLite (`shipments` table).
3. Query SQLite and render from DB-backed state.

DB initialization happens on app launch.

## Mock API (optional)

The app will work without any server (it injects the dataset if offline).

If you want to run a mock server, expose a GET endpoint:

- `GET http://10.0.2.2:3000/shipments` (Android emulator)

## Background Route Sync (Android)

The custom native module schedules a WorkManager job that queries the local SQLite DB for active shipments and posts a notification with their names.

- Schedule: every 60 minutes
- Manual trigger: Settings → “Manual Sync”

## Tests

Run unit tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
